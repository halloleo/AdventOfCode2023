### Solutions in various languages to some Advent of Code 2023 puzzles


A few years ago (I think in 2021) I had heard for the first time about [Advent of Code][aoc]. Last year I missed the beginning of the programming challenge, so this year for the end of November  I had set myself a reminder to look at Advent Of Code. And now I have decide to participate this year.

However, with family and work, I am not planning to tackle the puzzles _every_ day, but regularly -- and I want to use _a variety of languages for the different puzzles_.
