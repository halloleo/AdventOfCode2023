## Count Things and Sum Them Up

### Solved in Emacs Lisp

The logarithm was reasonably simple, but I was fighting a bit with _parsing_ and munging the input data via Lisp. 

So I "cheated" a bit and used _my editor_ Emacs  to bring the input in Lisp form so that _my Lisp interpreter_ Emacs understands it directly.

**Bottom line:** I still had to write a lot of list munging functions, which felt a bit tedious. Emacs Lisp didn't feel elegant to me for this puzzle, despite the fact that I have done quite a bit of "hacking" in Emacs Lisp.
