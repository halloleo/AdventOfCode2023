## Day 5: Jump Through Some Maps and Find a Minimum

### Solved in [Nim][lang]

This one was a bit more involved: First there was the multi line input parsing into map structures and than jumping through these maps. 

Nim has similar to Python everything it needs to solve this challenges efficiently. I had to search for some particular language constructs, because it has been more than a year that I had used Nim. 

For the second challenge, my solution is rather slow. -- So, on my trusty 2012 iMac it would have taken too long. Therefore, I complied the code on my new M2 Mac mini, and the job was done in a few hours.

**Bottom line:** Nim felt elegant for this puzzle. The static types help to think what data structures you need and the type _inference_ keeps writing the code still pretty small and simple.
